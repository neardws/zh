Cooperative Sensing and Heterogeneous Information Fusion in VCPS: A Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach\\
**Xincao Xu**, Kai Liu, Penglin Dai, Ruitao Xie, and Jiangtao Luo

- We present a VEC architecture, in which heterogeneous information can be cooperatively sensed and uploaded via V2I communications. Logical views can be constructed by fusing the heterogeneous information at edge nodes. 
- We derive a cooperative sensing model based on the multi-class M/G/1 priority queue. On this basis, we define a noval metric AoV by modeling the timeliness, completeness, and consistency of the logical views.
- We formulate the problem, which aims at maximizing the quality of VCPS. 
- We propose a multiagent DRL solution, where a difference-reward-based credit assignment is designed to divide the system reward into the difference reward for vehicles, reflecting their individual contributions.

Joint Task Offloading and Resource Optimization in NOMA-based Vehicular Edge Computing: A Game-Theoretic DRL Approach\\
**Xincao Xu**, Kai Liu, Penglin Dai, Feiyu Jin, Hualing Ren, Choujun
Zhan, and Songtao Guo

- We present a NOMA based architecture in VEC, where heterogeneous resources of edge nodes are cooperated for real-time task processing. 
- We derive a V2I transmission model by considering both intra-edge and inter-edge interference and formulate a cooperative resource optimization (CRO) problem by jointly optimizing the task offloading and resource allocation, aiming at maximizing the service ratio.
- We decompose the CRO into two subproblems: 1) task offloading, it is modeled as an EPG, and a MAD4PG is proposed to achieve the Nash equilibrium by adopting the potential function as reward function; and 2) resource allocation, it is modeled as convex optimization problems to allocate communication/computation resources, and an optimal mathematical solution is proposed based on a gradient-based iterative method and KKT condition.
